# let-me-see-you
Simple python script that takes a webcam photo and stores it to file system. It's supposed to be added to system startup to be able to see who is using your pc when you're not there ;-)

# Installation
For this script to run OpenCV should be set up.
Installation instructions for Windows can be found here:

http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html

**Make sure to install the latest numPy version out there, not the one provided in those instructions**
